# arduino-interpreter
A fully customizable Arduino or ESP8266 Command Interpreter that uses function syntax you're already familiar with!
It can be used to human readable communication between devices. Simply give a command like you would do when coding. See:

*** The leading > is mandatory, without it, you may send any kind of nonsense through the serial port and it won't lead to misbehaviour 

>car.turn(90)
>stop()
>lcd.show(Hello world)
>print(Thomas,John,Peter)

Just put your code inside the interpret() function.
I've also included a forwardable text feature. To use it, put your text within brackets. 

"Good afternoon, Sir!"

Interpreter comes with a sum example and lots of comments to help you. Type >math.sum(182,233) to get the result. Yeah, simple like that.
